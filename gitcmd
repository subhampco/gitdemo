I have struggled a lot in git only for setting credentials in linux environment
after researching and watching many resources i got the idea
but wasted many hours in this simple thing window and mac having no issue but in linux 
we have to take care extra
credential helper cache feature it means remember my credential
git config --global credential.helper cache

now yo have to get token from your github page
goto settings => developer settings => classical token=> generate one token

now come to your terminal
$git remote set-url origin https://token@github.com/curious08/gitdemo.git

now it will not ask for password
